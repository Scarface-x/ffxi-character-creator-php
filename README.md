A straightforward character creation website built using PHP and HTML, designed to provide enhanced control over the character creation process.

This platform can be further customized to enable even greater flexibility, such as allowing users to create characters with alternative character models beyond those typically permitted by POL.

Planned Features and Improvements:
* Implement email verification: send a confirmation email with a link to activate the account before it can be used.
* Enable users to update their registered email address.
* Add CAPTCHA functionality to the registration process for improved security.
* Refine the webpage layout for displaying user characters, especially when the maximum number of players exceeds three.
